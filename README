EC2 Launcher
============
EC2 Launcher is a simple program to view ec2 instances and log into them or 
transfer files to/from the various instances.  The program provides a simple
but detailed interface into the EC2 instances, along with intuitive vim-like
key bindings to navigate the UI. 

EC2 Launcher is licensed under the GNU GPLv3
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt)

Dependencies
============
EC2 Launcher requires boto, the urwid library, and python2. It is also assumed 
that ssh and scp exist on the system.

Installation
============
To install, move the file ec2config.sample to /etc/ec2config and fill in the
missing information.  You must then create the keypair directory with two 
subdirectories: test and prod.  Put your private keys in here.

Usage
=====
EC2 Launcher is simple to use.  There are two interfaces: the CLI and the GUI.

GUI:

    To launch the gui, run 
    > ec2.py prod list
    - or -
    > ec2.py test list

    You will be faced with a list of instances on your EC2 account.
